# Winforms-Tab-System
Hi Guys!  I recently was going through my old sources and found an old tab system (that's why the tabs' backend is poorly written xd). I added monaco to it and slightly improved it, here's a video:

It uses multiple browser instances, so it may have a high memory usage, feel free to modify it.

Credits are shown in the video and included in the source code.
